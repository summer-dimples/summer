# File that is contains models:

1. `Closed_Model1.ipynb` for model 1
2. `lane changes and multiple lane (1).ipynb` for model 2
3. `Long_Model.ipynb` for model 3

# Finished models:

1. simple closed one lane model with 4 behaviour from 'A cellular automaton model for freeway traffic'
2. closed two lane model adding lane swapping

# summer

CA model multiple lane and lane changes

What I am doing:
Processing the model for long road with different vmax.
