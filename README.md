Please download the Closed_Model1.ipynb file, to run the simulation and plot, remove # in front of some code.

# What is already done:

1. simple one lane model with 4 behaviour from 'A cellular automaton model for freeway traffic'
2. gif animation to show our model

# summer

CA model

# Gary

Problem:

1. the definition of flow. In our model, we run the simulation, and the flow we get is much smaller than it in reference(A cellular automaton model for freeway traffic)

To be done:

1. Multiple pane and swap lane
2. traffic signals
