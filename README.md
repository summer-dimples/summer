# Cellular Automaton

Done by Jinxun Chen and Yixuan Huang.
File that contains code:

1. `Closed_Model.ipynb` for basic
2. `Long_Model.ipynb` for complex
3. `flow_density_highd.ipynb` for generating plot using data from HighD

Due to copyright reasons, we are not able to provide the HighD dataset file.
We initially developed and tested our code in Jupyter Notebook. Once the code was ready, we converted it to pure Python files and ran them for better efficiency.
